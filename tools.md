# Tech Tools

### Learning Management Software (LMS)
- Google Classroom - Standard posting of material. Simple gradebook and forms and questions.
- (Optional if doable) Moodle - Open source learning management software (similar to blackboard). Much better if you can host it yourself. Downside is if hosting yourself, you have to manage and troubleshoot yourself.

### Communication
- Google Classroom - For whole class discussion/share-outs - I have students type and comment in the assignment posted. Students can review and respond to other students for a specific assignment. Downside is just text, not pictures or emojis and more from a dedicated communication tool
- Email - most common form of communication with students. I specifically ask students to email me so I have everything in one place to respond to and search.
- (optional) If I had to, I would keep it within the same software family and choose google chat to create chat rooms and group threads. However, gchat is not yet intuitive or well used so I have held off for now.
- (optional) I've used remind which is specifically to coomunicate directly, group, class, broadcast messages to everyone. It's a much better communication tool that I used in my previous school. However, only if students use it and school wide at that. Otherwise, it's another tool that is ignored.
- (optional) Pupilpath emails - Students can email/message teachers in the app directly. Though not perfect, it is used by teachers and students sporadically. The website and app is not intuitive, clucky, buggy, and not that great to use. Also, administrators have access to all grades and messages sent in the software.

### Presentation
- Google classroom - posting of assignments and materials
- Google Slides - to present information
- Google Meet - Screen share my slides.
- Google Jamboard and touchscreen laptop - able to handwrite and display on the screen. Allows student collaboration and to see how it's written in real time which is tremendously helpful.

### Assessments
- Google Forms for informal, quick assessments
- Moodle - major assessments - provides integrity, security, and exam software options for formal assessments
- Kahoot/quizlet - informal assesments

### IDE
- Repl.it - online, web-based IDE. Most capable web based so far, and accessible by most students
- VSCode - basic and popular IDE and configurable for many different languages. That's why even though I like Pycharm and others, VSCode is most versatile and not specific to a course or language.

### Data
- Google Sheets / MS Excel
- (optional) R - data science language/tools to analyze datasets


## Use of tech tools in Data Science Unit
For data science, it would be a combination of a few tools. Specifically for use with data science / big data, I would use google sheets. It's already in the google ecosystem so keep it simple. Students have used Excel which should have similar functionality. Students will enter, manipulate, analyze data all in sheets. Charts and other visuals can be created inside as well. Data can be stored as a csv file and imported into a program to be used.
