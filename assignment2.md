# Out of class assignment #2.

### Eric Liu

#### Objective: Students will search a new dataset to analyze. Follow up to in-class assignment that sets up the student with data skills.

SKills:
- Explore student's personal interest, connect to the data
- Practice the data organization skills
- Analyze a new dataset but in a student's personal interest. This allows them to use their personal experience and deeper understanding of the data to really provide a in-depth analysis.


Tasks:
- Choose a topic the student is interested in
- Choose a piece of data they are interested in finding out, or can find online (birth names, basketball stats, college admission statistics, products sold, social media clicks, etc)
- Students compile the data in a spreadsheet and organize it.
- Students have a vested interest in presented something interesting to their group/class.
- Analyze something specific and have student research the correlation and causation.


#### Next assignment would be to take it further and go deeper with how data is used or manipulated to prove different viewpoints. Common incorrect uses of data and data analysis. Then how data can be biased and influenced by many other factors.
