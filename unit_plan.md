# Unit Plan

## Data Science / Analytics

Students will encounter more and more data in the world that needs sorting and analysis. Whether it's a chemistry lab collecting data or social media collecting personal information. Students should know how to gather, identify, analyze relationships between data, and present the data in a meaningful way. 

In the AP CSP curriculum, there is a section on data and some higher level concepts that students need to know. I want to go further into this topic to teach more discrete and portable technical skills. This would include using spreadsheets or organizing data in general. Analyzing the data and seeing the relationships that are created by using conditionals, sorting, and scrubbing the data clean. Then presenting any interesting relationships students find in the data so it's understandable to everyone. This could be via charts, graphs, infographics.

In the BJC curriculum, there is one or two small labs towards the end of the course. I would extend those labs/lessons from just two to about 5 to 7 lessons. Long term, I want to introduce a small introductory lab earlier in the course to create a program to gather data and to display it. Then when we get to the end of the course with the original data and simulation labs, the second time they will see data, they can work on scrubbing, analyzing, and presenting the data in a more meaningful and insightful way.
